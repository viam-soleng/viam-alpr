# Viam-ALPR modular resource

This module implements a Viam vision service to automatically recognise license plates "alpr". It is based upon the [OpenALPR](https://github.com/openalpr) project which is a battle tested and pretty much state of the art alpr capability.

## Requirements

The module and its dependencies are packed into an AppImage. Therefore FUSE is required. FUSE however is used for the installation of Viam server as well and should therefore be available already.

## Build and run

To use this module, follow the instructions to [add a module from the Viam Registry](https://docs.viam.com/registry/configure/#add-a-modular-resource-from-the-viam-registry) and select the [`viamalpr` module](https://app.viam.com/module/viam-soleng/viamalpr).

## Configure your camera

> [!NOTE]
> Before configuring your camera you must [create a machine](https://docs.viam.com/manage/fleet/machines/#add-a-new-machine).

Navigate to the **Config** tab of your machine's page in [the Viam app](https://app.viam.com/).
Click on the **Components** subtab and click **Create component**.
